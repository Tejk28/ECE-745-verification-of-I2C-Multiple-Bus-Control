# Verification-of-I2C-Multiple-Bus-Control using System Verilog

Author: Tejashree Kulkarni

University: North Carolina State University
Professor: Bob Oden

Course: ECE 745; Verification using System Verilog and UVM
Duration: Jan 2023 â€“ May 2023 

The technology used: SVA, SVTB, CRV testing, Layered testbench Arch, OOPs 

Project Accomplishment:
- Verified the working of an I2C Bus controller using layered testbench components such as Generator, Drivers, Agent, 
Monitors, Scoreboard, Predictor 
- Virtual interface between the Design and testbench was used to established to drive the ports on a signal level basis 
Created a test plan, categorized the testcase into cover-groups and cover-points to generate necessary constrained random 
stimulus and placed SVA checkers for better debugging.  
- Successfully achieved 97.54% of Functional Coverage and 80% Code Coverage.
